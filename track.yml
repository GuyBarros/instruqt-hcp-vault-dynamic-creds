      # HCP Vault
      HCP Vault allows organizations to get Vault clusters up and running quickly, providing access to best-in-class secrets management and encryption capabilities with the platform providing resilience and operational excellence as a service.
  assignment: |-
    Sign up to HCP Vault if you haven't already: https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/

    In This track we will automate the creation of our enviroments, for this we will need HCP credentials for a Service Principal to use with Terraform.

    after signing up to Hashicorp Cloud Platform, navigate to Access control (IAM) -> Service Principal and generate a new Service Principal and Secret Key. Please note these down.

    In the bastion host terminal, export these credentials to your enviroment variables:
    ```
    export HCP_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_HCP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID>
    export HCP_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOU_HCP_SECRET_KEY>
    ```

    After this, please navigate to the terraform project directory:
    ```
    cd terraform-hcp-vault-dynamic-credentials-workshop
    ```

    Now we can use this bastion host to run our terraform project:
    ```
      terraform init
      terraform plan
      terraform apply
    ```

    For today we will follow the Instructor's guidance, written steps will follow shortly

  title: Exploring Service Principals
  teaser: Learn about HCP service principals.
  assignment: |-
    Now we'll generate three service principals.  Service principals come in 3 types:
    1. Admin
    1. Contributor
    1. Viewer
    A policy of least privilege can be used to limit API access to reading HCP state for things like Terraform data sources.  HCP lets you create named service principals and then create one or more tokens to access that service principal.  Be sure to delete any service principals you create during this workshop as they won't be destroyed when Instruqt expires your track.
