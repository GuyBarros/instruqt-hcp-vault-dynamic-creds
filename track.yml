    on This track we will automate the creation our enviroments, for this we will need HCP Service Principal to use with terraform.

    after signing up to Hashicorp Cloud Platform, navigate to Access control (IAM) -> Service Principal and generate a new Service Principal and Secret Key.
    please note these down.

    in the bastion host terminal, export these credentials to your enviroment variables:
    ```
    export HCP_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_HCP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID>
    export HCP_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOU_HCP_SECRET_KEY>
    ```

    after this, please navigate to the terraform project directory:
    '''
    cd terraform-hcp-vault-dynamic-credentials-workshop
    '''

    now we can use this bastion host to run our terraform project:

    ```
      terraform init
      terraform plan
      terraform apply
    ```

    ```
